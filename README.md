#### Scripts to extract timeseries from yearly MSWX/MSWEP (https://www.gloh2o.org/) netcdf files.  

The code is structured as follows:  
  mswx_data_funcs.py contains functions to process the raw netcdf files.  
  get_mswx_timeseries.ipynb is a jupyter notebook that runs by importing the mswx_data_funcs.py module.
